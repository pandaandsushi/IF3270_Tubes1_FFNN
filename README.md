# IF3270_Tubes1_FFNN - Feedforward Neural Network
A simple FFNN algorithm made from scratch in python

## Brief Overview 
In the development of artificial intelligence models, especially neural networks, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) is one of the most widely used architectures due to its simplicity and ability to handle various classification and regression tasks. FFNN works by flowing data unidirectionally from the input layer to the output layer through one or more hidden layers, where each neuron in the network has weights and biases that are updated during the training process.

## Features: Customizable Neural Network Architecture:
Accepts a list of integers representing the number of neurons in each layer (input, hidden, and output).

Fully customizable activation functions for each layer, including:
- Linear
- ReLU
- Sigmoid
- Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)
- Softmax


Loss Functions:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Binary Cross-Entropy
- Categorical Cross-Entropy


Weight Initialization:
- Zero Initialization
- Random Uniform Initialization (with optional bounds and seed)
- Random Normal Initialization (with optional mean, variance, and seed)
